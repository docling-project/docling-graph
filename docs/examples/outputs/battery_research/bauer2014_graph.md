- **Hypothesis**: The addition of a high molecular weight PVDF binder is sufficient to establish gel formation by b...
- **Conclusion**: The addition of a PVDF binder with sufficient long chain length was found to cause gel formation ...
- **Key Findings**: ['The addition of a high molecular weight PVDF binder is sufficient to establish gel formation by bridging flocculation in case of the nanoscaled cathode material.', 'For the larger micron-scaled particles, the formation of a stable coagulated state is also feasible but it requires the combination of a particulate CB gel and a strengthening PVDF polymer network.', 'The micron-sized NMC particles in association with the comparably small binder molecules did not allow a creation of a stable polymer gel structure.', 'The addition of nanosized carbon black was necessary to provide attraction between the NMC particles by formation of a particulate gel.']
- **Limitations**: Additives, like binder or carbon black, are chosen and optimized predominantly for their impact o...
